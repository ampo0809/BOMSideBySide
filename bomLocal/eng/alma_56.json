We supposed that we could overpower them; but behold, we were disappointed in this our desire.</p>\n<p class=\"verse\" data-aid=\"128353898\" id=\"p24\"><span class=\"verse-number\">24 </span>They durst not pass by us with their whole army, neither durst they with a part, lest they should not be sufficiently strong and they should fall.</p>\n<p class=\"verse\" data-aid=\"128353899\" id=\"p25\"><span class=\"verse-number\">25 </span>Neither durst they march down against the city of Zarahemla; neither durst they cross the head of Sidon, over to the city of Nephihah.</p>\n<p class=\"verse\" data-aid=\"128353900\" id=\"p26\"><span class=\"verse-number\">26 </span>And thus, with their forces, they were determined to maintain those cities which they had taken.</p>\n<p class=\"verse\" data-aid=\"128353901\" id=\"p27\"><span class=\"verse-number\">27 </span>And now it came to pass in the second month of this year, there was brought unto us many provisions from the fathers of those my two thousand sons.</p>\n<p class=\"verse\" data-aid=\"128353902\" id=\"p28\"><span class=\"verse-number\">28 </span>And also there were sent two thousand men unto us from the land of Zarahemla.

And thus we did lead away the most powerful army of the Lamanites;</p>\n<p class=\"verse\" data-aid=\"128353911\" id=\"p37\"><span class=\"verse-number\">37 </span>Yea, even to a considerable distance, insomuch that when they saw the army of Antipus pursuing them, with their might, they did not turn to the right nor to the left, but pursued their march in a straight course after us; and, as we suppose, it was their intent to slay us before Antipus should overtake them, and this that they might not be surrounded by our people.</p>\n<p class=\"verse\" data-aid=\"128353912\" id=\"p38\"><span class=\"verse-number\">38 </span>And now Antipus, beholding our danger, did speed the march of his army. But behold, it was night; therefore they did not overtake us, neither did Antipus overtake them; therefore we did camp for the night.</p>\n<p class=\"verse\" data-aid=\"128353913\" id=\"p39\"><span class=\"verse-number\">39 </span>And it came to pass that before the dawn of the morning, behold, the Lamanites were pursuing us. Now we were not sufficiently strong to contend with them; yea, I would not suffer that my little sons should fall into their hands; therefore we did continue our march, and we took our march into the wilderness.</p>\n<p class=\"verse\" data-aid=\"128353914\" id=\"p40\"><span class=\"verse-number\">40 </span>Now they durst not turn to the right nor to the left lest they should be surrounded; neither would I turn to the right nor to the left lest they should overtake me, and we could not stand against them, but be slain, and they would make their escape; and thus we did flee all that day into the wilderness, even until it was dark.</p>\n<p class=\"verse\" data-aid=\"128353915\" id=\"p41\"><span class=\"verse-number\">41 </span>And it came to pass that again, when the light of the morning came we saw the Lamanites upon us, and we did flee before them.</p>\n<p class=\"verse\" data-aid=\"128353916\" id=\"p42\"><span class=\"verse-number\">42 </span>But it came to pass that they did not pursue us far before they halted; and it was in the morning of the third day of the seventh month.</p>\n<p class=\"verse\" data-aid=\"128353917\" id=\"p43\"><span class=\"verse-number\">43 </span>And now, whether they were overtaken by Antipus we knew not, but I said unto my men: Behold, we know not but they have halted for the purpose that we should come against them, that they might catch us in their snare;</p>\n<p class=\"verse\" data-aid=\"128353918\" id=\"p44\"><span class=\"verse-number\">44 </span>Therefore what say ye, my sons, will ye go against them to battle?</p>\n<p class=\"verse\" data-aid=\"128353919\" id=\"p45\"><span class=\"verse-number\">45 </span>And now I say unto you, my beloved brother Moroni, that never had I seen <a class=\"study-note-ref\" href=\"#note45a\"><sup class=\"marker\">a</sup>so great</a> <a class=\"study-note-ref\" href=\"#note45b\"><sup class=\"marker\">b</sup>courage</a>, nay, not amongst all the Nephites.</p>\n<p class=\"verse\" data-aid=\"128353920\" id=\"p46\"><span class=\"verse-number\">46 </span>For as I had ever called them my sons (for they were all of them very young) even so they said unto me: Father, behold our God is with us, and he will <a class=\"study-note-ref\" href=\"#note46a\"><sup class=\"marker\">a</sup>not</a> suffer that we should fall; then let us go forth; we would not slay our brethren if they would let us alone; therefore let us go, lest they should overpower the army of Antipus.</p>\n<p class=\"verse\" data-aid=\"128353921\" id=\"p47\"><span class=\"verse-number\">47 </span>Now they never had fought, yet they did not fear death; and they did think more upon the <a class=\"study-note-ref\" href=\"#note47a\"><sup class=\"marker\">a</sup>liberty</a> of their <a class=\"study-note-ref\" href=\"#note47b\"><sup class=\"marker\">b</sup>fathers</a> than they did upon their lives; yea, they had <span class=\"page-break\" data-page=\"351\"></span>been taught by their <a class=\"study-note-ref\" href=\"#note47c\"><sup class=\"marker\">c</sup>mothers</a>, that if they did not doubt, God would deliver them.</p>\n<p class=\"verse\" data-aid=\"128353922\" id=\"p48\"><span class=\"verse-number\">48 </span>And they rehearsed unto me the words of their <a class=\"study-note-ref\" href=\"#note48a\"><sup class=\"marker\">a</sup>mothers</a>, saying: We <a class=\"study-note-ref\" href=\"#note48b\"><sup class=\"marker\">b</sup>do</a> not doubt our mothers knew it.</p>\n<p class=\"verse\" data-aid=\"128353923\" id=\"p49\"><span class=\"verse-number\">49 </span>And it came to pass that I did return with my two thousand against these Lamanites who had pursued us. And now behold, the armies of Antipus had overtaken them, and a terrible battle had commenced.</p>\n<p class=\"verse\" data-aid=\"128353924\" id=\"p50\"><span class=\"verse-number\">50 </span>The army of Antipus being weary, because of their long march in so short a space of time, were about to fall into the hands of the Lamanites; and had I not returned with my two thousand they would have obtained their purpose.</p>\n<p class=\"verse\" data-aid=\"128353925\" id=\"p51\"><span class=\"verse-number\">51 </span>For Antipus had fallen by the sword, and many of his leaders, because of their weariness, which was occasioned by the speed of their march—therefore the men of Antipus, being confused because of the fall of their leaders, began to give way before the Lamanites.</p>\n<p class=\"verse\" data-aid=\"128353926\" id=\"p52\"><span class=\"verse-number\">52 </span>And it came to pass that the Lamanites took courage, and began to pursue them; and thus were the Lamanites pursuing them with great vigor when <a class=\"study-note-ref\" href=\"#note52a\"><sup class=\"marker\">a</sup>Helaman</a> came upon their rear with his two thousand, and began to slay them exceedingly, insomuch that the whole army of the Lamanites halted and turned upon Helaman.</p>\n<p class=\"verse\" data-aid=\"128353927\" id=\"p53\"><span class=\"verse-number\">53 </span>Now when the people of Antipus saw that the Lamanites had turned them about, they gathered together their men and came again upon the rear of the Lamanites.</p>\n<p class=\"verse\" data-aid=\"128353928\" id=\"p54\"><span class=\"verse-number\">54 </span>And now it came to pass that we, the people of Nephi, the people of Antipus, and I with my two thousand, did surround the Lamanites, and did slay them; yea, insomuch that they were compelled to deliver up their weapons of war and also themselves as prisoners of war.</p>\n<p class=\"verse\" data-aid=\"128353929\" id=\"p55\"><span class=\"verse-number\">55 </span>And now it came to pass that when they had surrendered themselves up unto us, behold, I numbered those young men who had fought with me, fearing lest there were many of them slain.</p>\n<p class=\"verse\" data-aid=\"128353930\" id=\"p56\"><span class=\"verse-number\">56 </span>But behold, to my great joy, there had <a class=\"study-note-ref\"
